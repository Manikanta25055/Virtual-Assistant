This is a limited functionality 'voice to text' & 'text to voice' converter. 

The voice commands you are providing are predefined commands.
They are hard coded in python code. 

If you intend to add new commands then they have to hard coded again in the python code file. Then the code has to be compiled again before running. 

This is a sample or POC. 

Next steps- 

-There are pretrained models available from Amazon(LEX) or Google(Google assistant)
or Microsoft(Cortona)
- Figureout a way to use those pretrained models
- If you can just call those models using their API they can work with your app
- think and improve your POC. 
- Also modularise your code
